# Mixed Messages #

    This is my first portfolio project! I'm very excited to get started doing projects on my own. 
    This goal of this project is to created random messages using my knowledge of JS so far! 
    I will utilize JavaScript for now, until I learn more about HTML and CSS. 
    I will then turn this into a more interactive project.
    Hopefully I can accomplish this in an optimal time-frame!
